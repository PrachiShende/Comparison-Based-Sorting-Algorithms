Guide to execute the project 
Each sorting algorithm has a separate file.
Execute the files individually to check the independent execution of all the algorithms.


Step1: Put the files SortingTechniques_class.py and common_new.py files in the same folder
Step2: Run the file common_new.py
Three different graph tabs will be popped out 
	1. Sorted array
	2. shuffled array
	3. reversely sorted array ***

Description of Files:
SortingTechniques_class.py:
	This is a class file which contains all sorting techniques used. 
	Each method in this class implements different sorting algorithm.

common_new.py: 
	This file contains the data related to input, the function calling methods and the output.
After running the file common_new.py, we can see the graphs. 

InsertionSort.py :  Code for insertion sort algorithm

MergeSort.py : Code for merge sort algorithm

modified_QuickSort_median.py : Code for modified quick sort algorithm

Inlace_Quick_Sort.py : Code for simple quick sort algorithm.

VectorBased_Heaport.py : Code for heap sort algorithm.
